Got Injured, Now What?

<!--more-->

Felt the full force of a Chevy Tahoe and suffered a whiplash. I haven't had a good whiplash since the 9th or 10th grade when I was tackled during a two hand touch. Actually, whiplash was one of my favorite songs on the Kill 'em All album by Metallica. I miss that fast paced energy from that album because there really aren't many like it. I guess it falls into the thrash metal category, which is funny because none of Metallica's other albums sound like Kill 'em All, but they all end up sounding more and more like Metallica. I guess it goes to show how short the hype really lasts. You can't expect an act like that to keep thrashing. The prey must be swallowed eventually. 

Over the years I've heard people mention their "favorite" Metallica album and I'm always a little surprised because it's usually one of the few that came after Kill em All. I must admit it had sentimental value for me since it was my older sister who gave it to me as a Christmas gift. I listened to it on long drives and ended up falling asleep to the waves of distortion that seemed to all blend together like in a nice stew. My mom makes a good stew, but she hasn't always. She does it out of the conveniences of 21st century online consumerism. It's funny how convenience attracts even the most skilled or knowledgable. Or especially, rather. 

Anyway, although I don't necessarily feel like downloading the Kill em All album again (since all my cds are still in SD), I can still appreciate the relatability of it. It really sums up the rough and tumble world of a young teenage boy better than New Found Glory could ever do. That's why I'll never really understand pop punk the way that I understand Kill em All. 

Regardless, I'll need several weeks, at the bare minimum of acupuncture treatment from doctor Chun Lee in Oakland who is very nice and knowledge man I might add. It will be my first time getting treated by an acupuncturist so I was a bit nervous at first not knowing what to expect. The needles are actually somewhat painful to put in and take out. But while their in, they aren't so noticable. After about 1/2 hour to an hour of lying down with needles, it's onto some light massage and "fine tuning" as I would call it. I've had some top quality massages in recent years and I suspect that no one technique is the same as the next. There's little else that's more soothing than a pair of powerful hands rubbing out the bad stuff from your muscles. I suppose the correct term is lactic acid but don't quote me on that. 

So, in addition to acupuncture treatment for my aggravated neck and spine, I'll also be getting a good dose of chiropractor treatment as well as some pain management to seal the deal. I know a little about pain management from all the dental work I've had done and some surfing accidents. The key takeaway is that it's all in your head. I usually just think of how soliders had their limbs amputated with some whiskey and a foam roller to bite down on. That usually gives me enough perspective to get out without passing out. Can't imagine having someone cut through my bone with a hacksaw, but then again, I have James Franco to remind me. 

So, in short I am a little excited but mostly focused on improving physical state and cutting out activities that might jeopordize that. Hopefully the doc can snap my disks back in with a little help from my pillows.
